Have you made something cool with Xpublish that you want to show off? Well, the Xpublish-experiments org is the place for it.

Projects here aren't expected to be best practices, or maintained.
If you have a project you'd like to share, or you'd like to discuss something that is here, please use the 
[xarray-community/community discussions - show and tell category](https://github.com/xpublish-community/community/discussions/categories/show-and-tell).

(You don't have to transfer your repo to this org to show it off, you can also post it in the discussion)
